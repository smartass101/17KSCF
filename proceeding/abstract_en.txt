Interferometry is one of several ways to measure electron
density which is important for studying the behavior of plasma in the
GOLEM Tokamak. The method is based on sending a probing microwave beam with a frequency of about 70 GHz through a
system of waveguides (the dispersion line) through the plasma which causes
a phase shift in the probing beam. This phase shift is directly
proportional to the electron density. The beam then carries on through the waveguide system to the
mixer diode, where it interferes with the reference beam which has the same phase as the probing beam had before it passed through the plasma, because at the beginning the generated beam is split into the two, one goes through the dispersion line and the other one through the very short reference line directly to the mixer diode. The phase shift is then deduced from the interference of the two beams.
However, the interference cannot be easily analysed at the frequency of 70 GHz, therefore frequency modulation of the beams is utilized. A saw-tooth voltage generator makes the frequency of the generated beams periodically rise up to about 25 MHz . Because the beam traveling through the longer dispersion line arrives in the mixing diode with a certain delay in comparison to its reference beam, its frequency is slightly lower than the frequency of the reference beam. Therefore beats are produced and their envelope as a sine wave is measured and analysed, because the phase shift carried by the microwave beam is visible also in this envelope wave. By setting the right frequency modulation maximum in dependence on the length of the dispersion line, the frequency of the sine envelope will be again 500 kHz. This signal is then amplified in a selective frequency amplifier and passed on either to the analog analysis circuit which measures the phase shift of the envelope wave by comparing it to the output of the saw-tooth voltage generator, or the amplified signal is digitized and analysed on a computer.
