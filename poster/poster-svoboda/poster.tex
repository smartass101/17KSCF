\headerbox{Introduction}{name=intro,column=0,row=0}
{
Electron density measurement is one of the standard diagnostics in the field of plasma physics. 

The goal of this project was to adapt the old CASTOR implementation of the standard line-averaged electron density measurement via microwave interferometry to the new environment of the GOLEM Tokamak. This consisted of several steps
\begin{itemize}
        \compresslist
    \item Building the waveguide system
    \item Calibrating the diagnostic hardware 
    \item Developing a set of analytical and control scripts
\end{itemize}
 }

 \headerbox{Microwave Interferometry}{name=interf,column=1,span=2}
 {
 %info+schema
 \begin{multicols}{2} The refractive index of \textcolor{purple}{plasma} $n$ is dependent on the electron density $n_e$. Therefore, a microwave beam with $f \sim 75$ GHz \textcolor{green}{probing the plasma} undergoes a phase shift $\Delta \varphi$ which is directly proportional to $n_e$
%vzorec
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{schema.pdf}
$\Delta \varphi$ is extracted from the \textcolor{cyan}{interference} of the \textcolor{orange}{reference beam} and the \textcolor{green}{probing beam} from which the reference beam was split off, thus the \textcolor{orange}{ref. beam} has the same phase as the \textcolor{green}{probing beam} had before entering the \textcolor{purple}{plasma}.
%schema
\begin{equation}
    \overline{n_e}=\frac{ n_{crit}\lambda_0 }{d \pi}\Delta \varphi
    \label{eq:ne}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
        \compresslist
    \item $\overline{n_e}$ is the electron density line-averaged over the distance $d$ that the MW with a wavelength in vacuum $\lambda_0$ travels through plasma


%needs smth about n_crit
\item $n_{crit}$ is the critical density above which the MW cannot propagate through plasma\\ $f \sim 75 \,\text{GHz} \ldots n_{crit} \sim 6,9 \cdot 10^{19} \text{cm}^{-3}$
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
 }
\headerbox{Frequency Modulation}{name=modulation,column=0,below=intro}
 {
 %why, how
 %Instead of analyzing the signal with $f \sim 75 \,\text{GHz}$, the signal is transformed to 500 kHz by using frequency modulation. 
 The frequency of the MW generated by the Gunn diode is periodically and progressively increased by $\Delta f$ via a saw-tooth voltage generator. As the path covered by the probing wave is longer by $\Delta L$, the two interfering waves have a different frequency which produces beats. The absolute value of beats' amplitude oscillates with the frequency $f_{mod}=500$ kHz of the saw-tooth signal, provided that\begin{equation}
     \Delta f = \frac{c}{\Delta L} 
     \label{eq:mod}
 \end{equation}
 This signal is then selectively amplified for frequencies $ f_{mod} \pm 20$ kHz
 }



\headerbox{Waveguide System}{name=waveguides,column=1,span=2,below=interf} 
{
\begin{multicols}{2}
 %The diagnostic hardware was designed specifically for the waveguide system as it was built for the Czech Academy of Sciences during the ``CASTOR era'' of this Tokamak. 
 The new waveguide system had to have approximately the same length as the one built for CASTOR, because all the analogue hardware had been designed specifically for it. At the same time it had to fit into the modest room where the Tokamak is located.
 %few pics 

The total length is close to 10 m, which was achieved by constructing a ``trombone-like'' bend as seen in the Figure. \\

 %\headerbox{Data Analysis}{name=data,column=0,span=2,below=modulation}
 %{

 %nromal black boxes, and sine wave signal analysis
 \headerbox{Analogue Analysis Circuit}{name=analog,column=0,below=modulation}
 {
 \begin{multicols}{2}
 A set of logical gates compares the 500 kHz synchronised trigger signal with the next root of the sine signal and deduces the current phase shift and then processed with (1). 
 This happens for every eighth trigger signal, so the time resolution is only 62,5 kHz.\\
 \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{images/analog.pdf}
 \end{multicols}
 }
 \headerbox{Oscilloscope Digitization}{name=oscilo,column=1,below=modulation}
 {
The amplified signal is digitized with a sampling frequency of 25 MHz and then processed on a computer. The data sample is then fitted to a function $f(t)=A \cdot \sin (2\pi\cdot 5e5 t + \varphi)$ and $\varphi$ is extracted and processed with (1). 

Only ranges of points close to $0$ are processed, because there the signal is assumed to be the least influenced by amplitude dampening.
 }

\headerbox{Future Plans}{name=plans,column=2,row=3,below=modulation}
{
\begin{itemize}
        \compresslist
    \item  Overcome possible coupling with the chamber by using a new and well grounded saw-tooth voltage and trigger generator
    \item Further study of the influence of plasma stability once the Mirnov coils based plasma position stabilization system is operational
\end{itemize}

 \headerbox{Signal Disturbances}{name=disturb,column=0,row=2,span=3,below=ref}
 {
 %what why
 \begin{multicols}{2}
     During many discharges the frequency of the amplified signal suddenly increases and then returns back to normal. Both methods of analysis interpret this as sudden jumps in density, sometimes even to negative values. 

These higher frequency signals also are not fully amplified  and thus may not be correctly analysed.
     
A possible explanation is that there is a coupling of the chamber and the diagnostic hardware through the waveguide system which results in a change of $f_{mod}$ and/or $\Delta f$.
     \begin{itemize}
             \compresslist
         \item a change in $f_{mod}$ means the frequency of the amplified signal also changes. At the same the frequency of the trigger signal would change
         \item a change in $\Delta f$ would disrupt (2), hence only the frequency of the amplified signal would change
     \end{itemize}
A clear connection to the behaviour of plasma has been observed 
\begin{itemize} 
        \compresslist
    \item Increasing the stability of the discharge by increasing the temperature of the chamber has proven to reduce the number of disturbances
    \item These disturbances occur usually after the initial exponential rise in density at the beginning of the discharge
     \end{itemize}
